# Daily C & Python Practice

This repository is a daily coding log where I implement the **programming concepts in both C and Python**.

The goal is not speed or volume, but:
- building strong fundamentals
- understanding low-level vs high-level behavior
- developing consistency and problem-solving discipline
- building projects while learning!!!

## Long-Term Goal

To build a strong foundation for:
- speak C and Python without hassle
- cybersecurity
- automation
- cloud security
- tools and scripts

## Structure

C programs and Python programs are organized separately
